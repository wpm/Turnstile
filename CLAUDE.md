## Commit and PR conventions

- **Commit titles MUST follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):**
- **PR titles MUST follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):**
- Types and their release effect on `Turnstile`: `fix` → patch bump, `feat` →
  minor bump, `!` suffix or `BREAKING CHANGE` footer → breaking bump
  (compressed semver below 1.0). Also available: `docs`, `refactor`, `perf`,
  `test`, `build`, `ci`, `chore`, `revert`.
- Branch commits are squashed away, so their messages are not enforced —
  but use the conventional format there too; it keeps history legible and
  PR titles honest.
- When creating a PR for an issue, ensure that it when it closes, the issue
  closes as well.
